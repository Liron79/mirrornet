## Installation steps:
1. Python version: 3.12.0
2. Run: python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

## Generate Results Recipe:
### Manually:
#### Settings: M, Rin
1. Run mirror_flow with M, Rin - Ro [single run with multiple mirrors]
2. Run Zmirror_training with Rin, Ro, M - model [single run  with many data]

### Automatically:
#### Settings: model, Rin, Ro
1. Run model_flow_exp - M_model
2. Run mirror_flow with M_model - generate Ro_model
3. Run eval to generate comparisons between Ro_model to Ro
